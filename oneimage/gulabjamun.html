                <h2>Step-1</h2>
                <p>
                    To make the syrup, gently heat the cardamom, sugar and 500ml water in a saucepan. Don't let the water boil before the sugar has dissolved. Simmer for 10 mins, then cool.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Step-2</h2>
                
                <p>Gradually add the rosewater, saffron and a little of its soaking liquid until you have a subtly flavoured syrup. Set aside.

                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Step-3</h2>
                
                <p>To make the gulab jamun, use a pestle and mortar to grind together the cardamom and sugar until fine.  </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Step-4</h2>
                <p>Sieve the milk powder, flour and baking powder into a mixing bowl and stir in the cardamom and sugar mixture. Rub in the 50g ghee or butter using your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</p>
                <br>        
                
                <h2>Step-5</h2>
                <p>Add the yogurt, lemon juice and enough milk to form a soft dough, taking care not to overwork the mixture.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Step-6</h2>
                <p>Oil your hands with a little sunflower oil and shape small portions of the dough into walnut-sized balls, about 3cm in diameter and 20g each. Make sure the dumplings are smooth and have no cracks or folds.

                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Step-7</h2>
                <p>Reheat the syrup until it comes to the boil, then turn off the heat and cover with a lid.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Step-8</h2>
                <p>Heat the 1kg ghee in a wok or karahi to 130C or until a small piece of dough dropped in turns golden in 40 seconds. Fry the balls, in batches, over a medium heat for 5-7 mins, moving them around until they are an even, deep brown. Remove from the saucepan using a slotted spoon, then drain on kitchen paper. Add to the warm syrup, leaving them to soak for 2-3 hrs or preferably overnight.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Step-9</h2>
                <p>When ready to eat, warm the gulab jamun through in a wide saucepan, spooning over the syrup. Serve piping hot with the pistachios scattered over.</p>

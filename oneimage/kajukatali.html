                <h2>Step-1</h2>
                <p>
                    Place 1 cup cashews (kaju) in a dry grinder or coffee grinder or blender. I usually keep cashews at room temperature. Hence the cashews are dry.


                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Step-2</h2>
                
                <p> Grind the kaju to a smooth powder, making sure you don’t over do the grinding process as fat should not release from the cashews.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Step-3</h2>
                
                <p>Combine ½ cup sugar and 5 tablespoons water in a thick bottomed pan (or kadai or a non-stick pan).</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Step-4</h2>
                <p>Keep on low flame and let the sugar dissolve in the water. There is no consistency in the sugar syrup like one string or two string. Simply let the sugar dissolve in the water and then proceed with the next step.

.</p>
                <br>        
                
                <h2>Step-5</h2>
                <p>Keep on low flame and let the sugar dissolve in the water. There is no consistency in the sugar syrup like one string or two string. Simply let the sugar dissolve in the water and then proceed with the next step.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Step-6</h2>
                <p>Keep on low flame and let the sugar dissolve in the water. There is no consistency in the sugar syrup like one string or two string. Simply let the sugar dissolve in the water and then proceed with the next step.When the sugar completely dissolves in the water, add the cashew powder.

                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Step-7</h2>
                <p>Stir and keep on stirring non-stop on a low flame. If there are lumps then break the lumps as you stir and continue to stir. This consistent stirring is the key for a smooth and even kaju katli dough.

                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Step-8</h2>
                <p> The mixture will thicken and start coming together to form a very soft dough. Then it is time to remove the whole lump of the mixture from the pan and place it on a work surface. This process of making the kaju katli dough took me exactly 8 minutes on a low flame</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Step-9</h2>
                <p>Put the entire cashew dough on a work surface. Knead the dough lightly, flatten it and place it on a greased plate or tray. Roll to get a thickness of about 3 to 5 mm (about ⅛ inch). Then let the rolled cashew dough cool.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Step-10</h2>
                <p>Once cooled completely, cut the cashew dough into squares or diamond shapes. Scrape off the uneven edges and enjoy.</p>
